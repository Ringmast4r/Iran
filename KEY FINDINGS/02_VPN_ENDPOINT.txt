VPN ENDPOINT EXPOSED - MFA.GOV.IR
==================================

FINDING: Ministerial VPN hostname in public DNS

SUBDOMAIN: r1.vpn.minister.local.mfa.gov.ir
RESOLVES TO: 185.143.235.201 (ArvanCloud)

WHY IT MATTERS:
- "minister.local" = internal naming convention leaked
- "r1" suggests multiple endpoints (r2, r3...)
- Target for credential stuffing/brute force
- VPN software version could be fingerprinted

RELATED:
- cp.mfa.gov.ir (Control Panel) -> 109.201.11.102
- ORG confirmed: "Foreign Ministry of IRAN"

STATUS: HIGH VALUE - Attack surface
