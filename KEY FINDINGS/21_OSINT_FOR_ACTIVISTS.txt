OSINT IDEAS FOR ACTIVISTS & RESEARCHERS
=========================================
How collected intel can help Iranian people
Last Updated: January 5, 2026

================================================================================
[1] ARVANCLOUD - SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE
================================================================================

FINDING: All Iranian gov sites depend on ArvanCloud CDN (AS205585)

HOW THIS HELPS ACTIVISTS:
- Monitor ArvanCloud status = know when gov sites are down
- If ArvanCloud has issues, regime propaganda offline
- Single target for disruption vs. distributed infrastructure

IRONIC TWIST - CDN BYPASS METHOD:
- Activists use ArvanCloud CDN to BYPASS censorship
- Protocol: shadowsocks+v2ray+websocket+tls+cdn
- Hide VPN behind ArvanCloud IPs (ISPs won't block)
- Works during protests when other methods fail

MONITOR:
- 185.143.232.0/22 (ArvanCloud IP range)
- *.ns.arvancdn.ir (nameservers)
- ArvanCloud is US/UK SANCTIONED (but EU removed sanctions)

================================================================================
[2] SIAM SURVEILLANCE AWARENESS
================================================================================

CRITICAL: SIAM is Iran's mobile surveillance system

WHAT SIAM CAN DO TO ACTIVISTS:
- Track location via cell towers
- Read SMS messages
- Force phone to 2G (easier to intercept)
- Slow data to unusable speeds
- Access father's name, address, employer, billing
- Track Wi-Fi and IP history

PROTECTION ADVICE FOR ACTIVISTS:
- Assume ALL calls/SMS are monitored
- Use end-to-end encrypted apps (Signal)
- Disable 2G fallback if possible
- Use separate "protest phone" with no personal data
- Be aware: regime officials DON'T use VPNs (leaked X data)
- There is "digital apartheid" - elite have unrestricted access

================================================================================
[3] SHODAN RECONNAISSANCE
================================================================================

FINDING: Nearly 2 million Iranian devices indexed on Shodan

OSINT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Search: country:ir (general Iran)
- Search: country:ir city:tehran (capital)
- Search: country:ir port:22 (SSH servers)
- Search: country:ir product:apache (web servers)

EXPOSED DEVICES FOUND:
- Government webcams with compounds visible
- ICS/SCADA systems (critical infrastructure)
- Unpatched servers with known vulnerabilities
- IoT devices with default credentials

HOW THIS HELPS:
- Map regime infrastructure
- Identify weak points
- Document security failures
- Build IP block lists for activists

================================================================================
[4] TRACKING REGIME PROPAGANDA VIA ANALYTICS
================================================================================

COLLECTED TRACKING IDS (from our OSINT):

GOOGLE TAG MANAGER:
- GTM-TLJW8TR = almanar.com.lb (Hezbollah)
- GTM-PZ3N9B8 = tasnimnews.com (IRGC)

GOOGLE ANALYTICS:
- G-8MVZ1HLJT0 = khamenei.ir
- G-JJ1SM3JFZW = almanar.com.lb
- G-MGYZR3Q3BS = tasnimnews.com
- G-F359E8PMME = presstv.ir

MICROSOFT CLARITY (SESSION RECORDING):
- cgaike4iub, cs22bibpe3 = almanar.com.lb
- o2z34ibfin = mehrnews.com

HOW THIS HELPS RESEARCHERS:
- Google/Microsoft have data on these sites
- Subpoena potential for traffic patterns
- Can request account info from Google/MS
- Cross-reference to find linked properties
- Monitor for new properties added to same accounts

WARNING FOR ACTIVISTS:
- These sites record your behavior (Clarity)
- Use Tor or VPN when accessing regime media
- Disable JavaScript to prevent tracking

================================================================================
[5] SAFE VS UNSAFE VPN IDENTIFICATION
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Many VPNs in Iran are government-controlled traps

RED FLAGS:
- VPNs promoted on state media
- VPNs available without circumvention
- Free VPNs with no known organization behind them
- VPNs that don't use obfuscation

TRUSTED OPTIONS (per research):
- Proton VPN (Stealth protocol designed for Iran)
- Outline VPN (Google Jigsaw backed)
- Tor with Snowflake bridges
- Lantern

CDN-BASED BYPASS (works during shutdowns):
- shadowsocks + v2ray + websocket + TLS + CDN
- Uses major CDN IPs that can't be blocked
- Works even during cellular shutdowns in protests

================================================================================
[6] CERTIFICATE TRANSPARENCY MONITORING
================================================================================

FINDING: Regime domains exposed via CT logs

DISCOVERED VIA CT:
- admin.english.khamenei.ir (admin portal)
- All embassy subdomains (182 for mfa.gov.ir)
- Hidden internal systems

HOW ACTIVISTS CAN USE:
- Monitor crt.sh for new *.gov.ir domains
- Watch for new propaganda sites
- Identify when regime launches new services
- Find admin/internal subdomains accidentally exposed

TOOLS:
- crt.sh (Certificate Transparency search)
- Censys.io (certificate database)
- Google Transparency Report

================================================================================
[7] STARLINK ACCESS (POST JUNE 2025)
================================================================================

DEVELOPMENT: SpaceX activated Starlink for Iran

CONTEXT:
- June 13, 2025: Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities
- Regime cut ground-based internet to millions
- SpaceX activated Starlink satellite internet
- Bypasses ground infrastructure entirely

HOW THIS HELPS:
- Satellite = cannot be blocked by ISPs
- Direct-to-cell technology emerging
- FREEDOM Act (Dec 2025) evaluating expansion
- No reliance on Iranian telecom infrastructure

LIMITATIONS:
- Requires Starlink hardware (hard to obtain in Iran)
- Direct-to-cell not yet widely available
- Regime may attempt to jam signals

================================================================================
[8] HEZBOLLAH INFRASTRUCTURE MAPPING
================================================================================

FINDING: Hezbollah uses Russian/Hungarian hosting

HOSTING DETAILS:
- moqawama.org.lb: 91.109.206.65 (Moscow, AS199669)
- almanar.com.lb: 5.35.14.166 (Moscow, AS50340)
- awt-lb.com DNS: 185.112.156.85 (Hungary, AS210772)

HOW THIS HELPS ACTIVISTS:
- Target specific ASNs for monitoring
- Identify new Hezbollah domains via same hosting
- Report to hosting providers (may not care, but documented)
- Build comprehensive block lists

KEY INSIGHT:
- awt-lb.com = likely Hezbollah-controlled DNS
- Monitor for new domains using this DNS
- Pattern: Lebanese TLD (.lb) + Russian hosting

================================================================================
[9] INTERNAL NETWORK LEAKS
================================================================================

DISCOVERED LEAKS:
- kateb.irna.ir -> 10.30.41.85 (private IP exposed!)
- r1.vpn.minister.local.mfa.gov.ir (VPN endpoint)
- jira.farsnews.ir, git.farsnews.ir (dev tools)

HOW THIS HELPS:
- Reveals internal network structure
- Shows misconfiguration patterns
- Identifies potential entry points
- Documents regime technical incompetence

IRNA INTERNAL NETWORK MAP:
- 10.30.41.x = Editorial systems
- 217.25.48.x = Mail, Gallery
- 217.25.58.x = Remote access

================================================================================
[10] EXIF METADATA FOR ATTRIBUTION
================================================================================

FINDING: Propaganda images contain metadata

COLLECTED:
- Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (2002!) = pirated software
- CS6 (Windows) timestamps
- Working hours reveal Beirut timezone
- WhatsApp filenames preserved (opsec failure)

HOW THIS HELPS:
- Track individual content creators
- Prove state involvement in propaganda
- Document patterns for attribution
- Legal evidence for sanctions cases

================================================================================
