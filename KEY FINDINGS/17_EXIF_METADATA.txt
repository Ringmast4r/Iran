FINDING: Photoshop metadata preserved in propaganda graphics

FILE             | SOFTWARE              | TIMESTAMP
-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------
1679.jpg         | Adobe Photoshop 7.0   | 2023-04-15 15:27:26
1713.jpg         | Adobe Photoshop 7.0   | 2023-05-31 07:13:38
1808.jpg         | Photoshop CS6 (Win)   | 2014-07-22 16:07:36

ANALYSIS:
- Photoshop 7.0 (2002 software) = likely pirated
- Multiple files from same workstation
- Timestamps = Beirut working hours (GMT+2/+3)
- CS6 (Win) = Windows environment

WHATSAPP OPSEC FAILURE:
- File: "WhatsApp Image 2025-12-13 at 9.50.45 AM.jpeg"
- Location: english.alahednews.com.lb
- Staff uploads directly without renaming

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Can track individual content creators
- Working hours reveal timezone/location
- WhatsApp patterns expose workflow
- Pirated software = sanctions compliance failure
